# SaclaySlither
... is yet another game with snakes.

## Play

It's a game with few rules
1. eat food to grow
  1. bigger you are and better will be your sight
1. do not hit your snake's head against another snake or you're dead
  1. if you put your body in front of another snake you may kill it
1. press space to accelerate
  1. but fast snakes are also more difficult to control since they do not turn as good as slow ones
